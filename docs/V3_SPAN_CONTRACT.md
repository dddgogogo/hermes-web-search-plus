# WSP 3.1 Semantic Span Contract

`span_contract_version: 1`

Semantic spans are an opt-in extraction result field. Set `spans: true` on
`web_extract_plus`; `spans_query` may provide the ranking query. When an
originating query is carried by an internal extract invocation, it is used as
the default. Without either query, ranking uses deterministic lexical-density
and position heuristics.

## Offset contract

Every offset is a Python-style Unicode codepoint index into the complete
retained cleaned text after Unicode NFC normalization. Offsets are not UTF-8
byte offsets and are not UTF-16 code-unit offsets. They also do not address the
raw, pre-NFC provider string.

Ranges are half-open: `[start, end)`. For the NFC string `full_text`, every span
obeys:

```python
0 <= span["start"] < span["end"] <= len(full_text)
span["text"] == full_text[span["start"]:span["end"]]
```

Returned spans are non-overlapping and sorted by `start`. Selection is
deterministic: candidate score ties are resolved by descending score and then
ascending start offset; final output is source ordered. No clock, randomness,
network service, or model is involved.

## Result shape

When spans are enabled, every extraction result has:

```json
{
  "span_contract_version": 1,
  "spans": [
    {
      "start": 120,
      "end": 181,
      "text": "The exact selected text from the retained NFC document.",
      "score": 4.25,
      "within_preview": true
    }
  ]
}
```

`within_preview` is true only when the complete half-open span is present in
the inline bounded-context `content`/projected `text` preview. Truncate-and-store
does not change span offsets: offsets always address the full retained cleaned
text, including spans beyond the inline preview. The retained text is the same
NFC text stored for page-on-demand access.

With `spans: false` (the default), neither `spans` nor
`span_contract_version` is added, preserving the existing response shape.

## Ranker seam

`span_extraction_v3.select_spans` accepts an optional `ranker` callable. It is
called as `ranker(candidate_text, normalized_query)` for each mechanically
segmented candidate and must return a finite numeric score. Omitting it uses
the standard-library lexical ranker (query term and adjacent-token shingle
overlap, lexical density, and a mild positional prior). This seam can host a
future embedding-backed ranker without changing offset construction or result
selection invariants.

Operator receipts and Operator Console payloads never include span text. The
current receipt projection omits semantic spans entirely; future receipt
versions may expose counts only.
